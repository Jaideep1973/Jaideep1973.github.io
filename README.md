                <h3> About Me </h3>
                  <p> My nationality is Australian, but ethnically I am from India, and I speak both Punjabi and English. I graduated high school last year and am currently completing a Bachelor of Information Technology. An interesting fact about me is that both my grandparents were born in Pakistan, and that some of my great grandfathers migrated from Iran and Afghanistan. Other facts about me are that I lift weights, am a fan of the UFC (GSP being my goat), and my favourite pastime is going out and drinking.

              <h2> Interest in IT </h2>
            </div>
                <h3What> What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? </h3>
                  <p> My interest in IT started from an early age, when my dad came home in 2010 with a dusty old computer that his boss was throwing away. I would use that computer 24/7 in awe of this new thing (for me at least), known as the internet. I think coming from a country and environment who at the time did not have a lot of technology, I became instantly interested in all the new phones, computers, and other technology in Australia. I started watching youtubers, such as MKBHD, bit wit, jayztwocents, Austin Evans and LinusTechTips, who all gave me insight to new software and hardware, and even inspired me to build my own computer after saving up. Additionally, I have always been fascinated by space and have dreamt of being an astronaut since I could talk, however math really is not my strong suit, so after research I discovered the importance of programmers, and other IT related experts required to be in the space industry, and thus pursued IT at RMIT.
                   <p/>
                <h3> Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h3>
                  <p> I came to RMIT because of its reputation in the field of computer science and information technology, ranking in the top 100 universities in the world in those fields. Additionally, I had lots of high school friends attending, and the city campus was in a much more favourable spot geographically than other offers.
                  </p>
                <h3> What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h3>
                  <p> I expect to build a solid foundation in all aspects of Information Technology, however if there were specific skills I want to master, it would be programming and learning different languages. I want to be able to confidently write complex programs and build a strong portfolio for future employers with projects I can be proud of. I also want to be able to make friends with likeminded people, build industry connections, and be able to produce industry standard work.

                <h3> Description </h3>
                  <p> The above position is of a Senior React developer to work alongside a small team of 14 other developers on a cloud-based Freight management system, with a head office in Richmond. The description calls for one on one client work with stakeholders to create new applications. The occupation is specifically appealing to me for many reasons, firstly it talks about a hybrid remote work model, meaning that I can choose to work from home. Work life balance is especially important to me, I would rather be with my family rather than spending most of my day on lengthy commutes to a corporate office daily. The other aspect that captivated me was the client work, I like being interpersonal with people rather than following menial tasks, such this allows room for creative thinking and adding personality into my work and career.
                  </p>
                <h3> Experience </h3>
                  <p> The positions calls for years of ‘experience with frontend applications,’ specifically using the ‘React framework,’ use of ‘GitHub’ and ‘Continuous integration,’ excellent communication, and comprehension skills as well as experience with ‘APIs such as REST, GRPC, and GraphQL.’ They also state that you would ‘develop your skills set with the latest frameworks including React, Docker Kubernetes and GraphQL,’ so knowledge in those areas would be crucial to be a standout candidate.
                  </p>
                <h3> My current Experience/Skills/Qualificiations </h3>
                  <p>Currently I have very beginner level experience with programming, being able to write extremely simple programs and code, I can integrate my work using GitHub, and have effective communication and comprehension skills. From research a bachelors in a related field (IT, Computer science, software engineering) is highly valued in such jobs, I plan to finish my bachelor's in information technology, additionally a solid understanding of core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is also crucial for front end development.
                  </p>
                <h3> My Plan </h3>
                  <p>  My current plan is to use w3schools, and freecodecamp to obtain an understanding of the previously mentioned languages, and start building a portfolio of personal projects, moreover I plan to find an internship or start freelancing for companies to build experience and interest from potential employers and eventually work my way to a fulltime job. I also intend to choose courses that major more in programming and computing aspect of IT, an internship would be especially beneficial as I can acquire industry connections, insight into real world IT work, as well as being exposed to co-workers with years of experience, giving me lots of learning opportunities.

                  </table>
                <h3> What the test results mean for me </h3>
                  <p> These results currently mean that I should undertake more challenging yet attainable objectives and goals. This is especially important for my career, a job environment which does not allow for innovation or challenge would be unmotivating and boring, and I would thrive with other co-workers with similar skillsets who work together to address problems. Being a hands-on learner, I would restructure my studying to be more interactive through flashcards, drawing out diagrams and examples in a way which makes sense to me, and demonstrating skills to other people, the big five personality test also reflects to me that I would work better in an environment which equally divides working with others and collaborating but also working by yourself, and having an equal balance between the two. While I do not think these results define my personality or behaviour to the fullest, I will use them as useful tools to improve myself.
                  </p>
                <h3> How do these results influence my behaviour in a team </h3>
                  <p> In terms of behaviour in a team environment, being a commander type I would be more drawn to leadership roles, or roles where everyone is equally contributing and discussing, rather than taking orders or being told what to do. A positive attitude is also important for me I would remain willing to find solutions to problems, I would also take extra responsibility as well as accountability for setbacks/mistakes/errors. A weakness of my given personality type is that I may be too dominant, stubborn, cold, arrogant, and impatient, while I do not think this is necessarily true, these results might make me more self-aware of my flaws so that I can work to correct them when necessary.
                  </p>
                <h3> Forming a team </h3>
                  <p> When forming a team, I would have to understand that each person has vastly distinctive characteristics regarding their personality type, their learning style, and their behaviour. It would be important to take all this into account so that a team can work together in a positive and efficient manner.

              <h2> Project Idea </h2>
            </div>
                <h3> Overview </h3>
                  <p> The project known as 'Vigilant', is an android and iOS application which allows users to track crime and other hazards in Victoria (Primarily Melbourne and its surrounding suburbs). Users can post their location with a description to alert others of possible criminal activity, dangers, or other hazards, in real time. A colour coded map allows users to dictate the criminal activity of the specific area they are in, as well as information of the type of crimes committed and when (data gathered from crimestastistics Victoria), a set of safety guidelines are also provided to users to keep individuals safe who are near specific dangers and hazards. The general purpose of the app is to keep the public vigilant and safe, especially those travelling to new areas.
                  </p>
                <h3> Motivation </h3>
                  <p> The project is specifically interesting to me as I have seen violent crimes take place both near and in overseas. A lot of these crimes occurred early in my time in Australia, my family being young and unaware of the safety of certain areas in Melbourne was witness and in some situations a victim to crimes, this scenarios after further thinking could have been avoided had we the knowledge of what areas are deemed hazardous due to certain criminal patterns.

‘On October 7, another teenager was attacked as he arrived home from his after-school job and dragged across the driveway of his home’ - https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/indian-community-in-fear-after-spate-of-attacks-in-melbourne-suburb-20201028-p566pi.html

 ‘Another victim, a 15-year-old boy, was beaten and robbed in the driveway of his own home as he returned home from work on October 9. Footage of the attack shows three youths kicking and punching the teenager and taking his backpack.’

https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/indian-community-in-fear-after-spate-of-attacks-in-melbourne-suburb-20201028-p566pi.html

 Both the above crimes took place in a small community in Manor Lakes, with Vigilant, victims of these crimes, or witnesses can post the location and description of the attacks, people who are travelling into, around, or staying in the area, are instantly notified, and therefore are made more aware of their surroundings taking extra precautions to be safe and preventing crimes such as this from occurring again.
                  </p>
                <h3> Description </h3>
                  <p> The project will be done using React Native framework

Interactive Map:

The main page when you open Vigilant on your mobile device, is the Interactive Heatmap of crimes in your area.

The map has 3 options in terms of scale, Local viewing (displaying the map in a 10km radius), Regional Viewing (displaying the map in a 25 km radius), and All (displaying all of Victoria).

The map is coloured in a heat style map, darker spots representing areas with more crime and activity, and lighter spots representing areas with less crime and activity. Zooming into the app allows you to see the specific crimes in each spot, indicated by different icons (eg: Thief mask showcasing robbery, Fists for assault etc). Upon clicking each Icon, a further description is given to the user, displaying crime statistics in the area, last known crime and when it was occurred, specific address, and ways to prevent this from occurring. Icons are both updated by developers but can also be added by users for real time updating of crime or other hazards.

A search bar is also present, allowing the user to search for specific addresses, suburbs, or residential communities. Upon results, the searched location is also given a safety rating based upon the number of crimes reported, recency of crimes, as well as how it is indexed on criminal statistic databases by the government.

The map data is also filterable, from type of crime, highest and lowest times for crime in areas, and date ranges from recent crimes to oldest.

Posting and commenting:

Posting and commenting is a unique feature among other ‘crime trackers’, like twitter people can post photos and video content at any given time. Each post is displayed on the map depending on where the user has chosen to tag their post, how long ago the post was made is also displayed. Each post has a short description of the issue, as well as a photo or video (optional), there is also an ‘add to this’ feature which allows other people to add their own information about the issue in a comment style section. Posts are available for a chosen period by the user.

The number of posts in each area also changes the map, for example if a high number of issues are reported by users in a certain area, that area on the map will change to a high alert zone until fewer posts are reported in the area. Statistics will also be given in high alert zones, such as number of posts made in a certain time period and the types of crimes reported.



Notifications:

Users are notified for several reasons. These being:

-Entering possibly crime filled areas (tracked through phone gps)

-new reports being made near the user (tracked through phone gps)

-leaving crime filled areas

-asking the user to rate high alert areas, and if they had any experiences


Of Course, notifications are all customizable, users are able to decide which notifications are allowed to show and which are not.

Users are also able to receive notifications from offences and crimes that have occurred in certain locations they choose to monitor.


Safety Feature:

Safety feature of the app is helpful in ongoing situations or dangers, users can access this from any menu page, and a list of issues are provided, clicking on each one gives the user simple clear directions on what to do based on their circumstances. For example, if on a bus the user encounters a violent and loud person, they are given directions on how to handle that situation. An emergency button is also readily accessible in every menu, which allows the user to directly dial all emergency numbers in Victoria depending on their circumstances.
                  </p>
                <h3> Tools and Technologies </h3>
                  <p> The app will be completed using the React Native framework, and android emulator, and an iOS emulator will also be needed to build the project. I will use the Visual Studio IDE as I already have previous experience using it during school, and because it provides easy visuals. In terms of hardware, I will need a computer with an internet connection to complete the project.
                  </p>
                <h3> Skills Required </h3>
                  <p> The main skills required for development of this app are knowledge of JavaScript, knowledge of React assumptions and basic elements, storing user data in real time, and debugging and testing skills. As for the hardware, a computer or laptop with ample storage, a strong internet connection, plenty of ram are all that’s required.

Feasibility:
The hardware is very feasible to gather, the software is also easy to install and operate, however the skills are where it becomes a challenge. A lot of the concepts are quite simple to create such as the interactive map, tracking the users gps, etc. It is the user input and real time updates and comments where it becomes a challenge, overall, however I think the app is quite feasible with enough research, googling for answers, and learning JavaScript.
                  </p>
                <h3> Outcome </h3>
                  <p> If the project is successful, people will be more diligent and aware of the dangers in their surroundings, being more vigilant will lead to amazing impacts. People will no longer place themselves in areas with high crime unknowingly, and people can make better informed decisions on where to move when looking for property. This app would also be a fantastic opportunity for me to build experience in app development and using a variety of frameworks.
                  </p>
